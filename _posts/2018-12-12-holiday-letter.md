Hi, it's been a while. But there's movement in this little corner of the internet - another few lines in this log. I thought a good excuse to dust off this blog would be to get some ideas "down on paper" for an upcoming holiday letter to friends and family. Plus some [coworkers](http://blog.geomusings.com/) who actually [consistently blog](https://www.colemanm.org/post/a-post-each-day/) have inspired me a bit lately. So, 2018 - here are some highlights:

* _February_ - Tahoe, CA w/ Sonia & Dauto; Paula's parents came to visit and we took a trip to South Lake with my sister Megan and her boyfriend Travis. Good times indeed!
* _February/March_ - Camp Roberts, CA; went to a [FX event](https://twitter.com/oeon/status/974035291366293504) representing [SNI/Fulcrum Community](https://twitter.com/oeon/status/969620835475513349) - saw some awesome experiments, as usual.
* _March_ - [Adobe Springs planting](https://twitter.com/oeon/status/972540203238703104); I've been getting involved with the [ALPS Native Tree Committee](http://www.supportalps.org/native-tree/) after seeing one of their signs near our house. It's been a great experience participating in their volunteer events and having another excuse to use [Fulcrum](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/).
* _April_ - St. Pete; [spring All Hands](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/spring-2018-all-hands/) was pretty crazy with the growth that [Spatial Networks](https://spatialnetworks.com/) is going through. Met a lot of new faces and laid the foundation for some good working relationships.
* _May_ - San Francisco, CA w/ Pablo & Camila; Paula's cousins came to visit and they're some of our favorite people in the universe. We took them to their first SF Giants game - which was very entertaining and the home team walked away with the **W**.

* _June_ - [Firestone Invitational](https://www.firestonebeer.com/brewery/invitational-beer-fest.php) üç∫
* _June_ - [Seinfeld](https://www.instagram.com/p/BkB3weVnfj1/); Paula and I went to see Jerry - it's not too often that bigger events come through our small part of the world. Great show!
* _June_ - Tahoe again; Tony's bachelor party

* _August/September_ - Africa; Nairobi, Kenya...Dar es Salaam & Zanzibar, Tanzania for [FOSS4G 2018](https://2018.foss4g.org/) I had the opportunity to travel to East Africa for work and had a simply wonderful time. The people, food, weather, and culture were all fantastic - only bummer are the long flights!

* _September_ - Dallas; Tony's wedding ...got to have a üåÆwith [Ry](https://www.fulcrumapp.com/blog/employee-spotlight-ry/).

* _November_ - [Firestone Anniversary](https://www.firestonebeer.com/brewery/anniversary-party.php) üçª
* _December_ - [Three Bridges Oak Preserve](https://twitter.com/oeon/status/1068975483696496640) work day; remapped, replanted, and refreshed the mitigation plantings near the trailhead.
* _December_ - here we are!

I'm not going to commit to anything forthcoming - but it _was_ nice to log a few lines again. I imagine I've omitted some highlights & I certainly have a whole lot to share since my last post over 2 years ago - like a [new job](https://twitter.com/oeon/status/702165685393174530) ... a new house, some new things I'm trying to learn, and other adventures. But we'll start with this üëãhope you're well.
